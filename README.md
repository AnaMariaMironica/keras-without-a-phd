# Keras without a PhD 

This repository contains a Keras version of 'TensorFlow and Deep Learning without a PhD' presentation from Google. 

The lab is taking few hours to be ran and understood. The exercises take you through the design and optimisation of a neural network for recognising handwritten digits, from the simplest possible solution all the way to a recognition accuracy above 99%. It covers feed-forward (with one or more layers with different activation functions) and convolutional networks, as well as techniques such as learning rate decay and dropout. We also perform a comparison with other classical machine learning techniques, such as Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and gradient boosted trees.
